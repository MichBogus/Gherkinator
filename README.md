# Gherkinator

This is pure concept of library to provide BDD testing. </br>
BDD stance fo Behavioral Driven Development, which besically means that it is largely </br>
facilitated through the use of a simple domain-specific language (DSL) using natural language </br> 
constructs (e.g., English-like sentences) that can express the behavior and the expected outcomes. </br> 

Ever wonder how world would look like if you as a technical person can provide all the information </br> 
about logic in application to person who doesn't understands programming languages? </br> 

If the answer for that question is "There is no possibility of that", than you should check for better </br> 
approach in doing your tests first. </br> 
</br> 
## Tests are important! </br> 

They provides us as a programmers with necessary logic about application we are working on. They behave as a documentation. </br>

## Gherkin language as BDD best option </br>
